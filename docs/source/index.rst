Shipaw - Python Client for Parcelforce ExpressLink
===================================================

Shipaw leverages `Combadge <https://kpn.github.io/combadge/>`_ to create a python client for interacting with the Parcelforce ExpressLink API.

Pydantic classes representing API calls are produced from the provided wsdl spec with `datamodel-code-generator <https://koxudaxi.github.io/datamodel-code-generator/>`_

Users need only instantiate the client and relevant pydantic models to book shipping services and download shipping labels.
